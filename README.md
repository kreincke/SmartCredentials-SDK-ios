# SmartCredentials-SDK-ios

Smart Credentials is a library with multiple generic functionalities. The focus is on having
components that are not application-specific, so that they can be easily integrated into multiple
applications.

Objects that are used in SmartCredentialsLibrary are called credentials. “Items” term is also used to
refer to credentials or any other generic type of object that can be stored in the library.
SmartCredentials is a generic library that aims to make credentials more intelligent by enabling
different actions on it and it also keeps them as generic as they can be. So the items is a more
generic term for referring to smart credentials objects.

One of the library’s purpose is to assists applications with retrieving and storing user related data. The
library itself is data type – agnostic and can handle both sensitive and plain user data. Based on the
data definition, the library has internal mechanisms to retrieve/store content or manipulate data
pieces.

Other features include QR-based login, barcode reader, OCR reader/parser, OTP generator,
fingerprint/pin/pattern/faceId authorization.
